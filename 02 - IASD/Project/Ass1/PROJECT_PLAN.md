# IASD Assignment #1 - Autonomous Gardening Robot

## Project Roadmap and Task Distribution

**Team:** Francisco, Marta and Diogo  
**Start Date:** September 9, 2025  
**Deadline:** September 26, 2025  
**Deliverable:** `solution.py` implementing the `GardenerProblem` class

---

# Project Summary

## Overview

We are developing an AI system to control an autonomous gardening robot in a Martian settlement. This is essentially a **path planning and scheduling problem** where the robot must efficiently navigate a grid world to water plants before their deadlines while managing limited water resources.

## Core Problem Elements

**Environment:**

- Rectangular grid (N√óM cells) representing the Martian settlement
- Cell types: obstacles (-1), empty spaces (0), plants (positive integers representing plant types)
- Robot starts at position (0,0) which is always empty and serves as the water refill station

**Plants:**

- Each plant type `k` has two critical parameters:
  - `wk`: water units required to water this plant
  - `dk`: deadline (in time steps) by which it must be watered
- Plants can only be watered **once** and **before their deadline**

**Robot Capabilities:**

- Actions: Move in 4 directions (U/D/L/R) or Water (W)
- Each action consumes exactly 1 time step
- Water capacity: W0 units (refills automatically when returning to (0,0))
- Cannot water if insufficient water remaining

**Constraints:**

- Must stay within grid boundaries
- Cannot move through obstacles
- Must respect plant deadlines
- Must have sufficient water to water each plant

## Technical Requirements

We must implement a `GardenerProblem` class inheriting from `search.Problem` with two key methods:

1. **`load(fh)`**: Parse input files with the specified format
2. **`check_solution(plan, verbose=False)`**: Validate solution plans

The solution must output a string sequence of actions (e.g., "DDWRRWUWUW").

### Input File Format

```
N M W0                    # Grid dimensions and water capacity
[N lines of grid data]    # Grid with -1=obstacle, 0=empty, k=plant type
[K lines of plant data]   # wk dk for each plant type k
```

### Output Format

- String of actions from {U, D, L, R, W}
- Example: "DDWRRWUWUW"
