Areas for Improvement
For true distributed cooperative control:

Eliminate Master-Slave Architecture:

The current wake-up process designates one node as master based on ID
Consider a consensus-based approach where all nodes participate equally
Enhanced Cooperative Algorithms:

Your current coordination only adjusts for light contribution
Consider consensus algorithms for joint decision-making
Implement distributed optimization for energy efficiency
Dynamic Role Assignment:

Instead of using static IDs to determine coordination roles
Implement an election algorithm based on current state and capabilities
Robust Network Topology:

Current implementation assumes all nodes can communicate with all others
Consider adding peer-to-peer routing for larger networks
Implementation Suggestions
To enhance the distributed nature:

Replace the ID-based coordinator selection with a distributed election algorithm
Implement a true consensus protocol for setpoint determination
Add fault tolerance mechanisms for node failures
Implement distributed optimization to minimize total energy use
